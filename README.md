- 👋 Hi, I’m @csfoster
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile phones, 4G and 5G EPC Core networks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about VoLTE, IMS, and messaging for mainstream commercial phones and some NOTso mainstream opensource phone projects.
       Installing and testing several HSS and PCRF vendors in our Lab and installing and testing various p-CSCFs and IMS systems with different phone OEMs. 
       Working through the Sysmocom SIM configuration for our network and other related projects. I am also testing several eNBs and looking for some gNB for our Lab.
       Maintaining multiple production data centers that support a high-volume mobile voice application. 
       Experience with the entire infrastructure stack for a production data centers, including 
       firewalls, switching, load balancing, remote access, almost everything VMware, Linux, Windows 
       and all the crazy applications for SIP voice networks.  Integration projects with every IPX provider 
       to support intercarrier data Roaming for Data, SMS, and MMS.         
       
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enabling VoLTE and as many commercially available devices as possible.
